# Mastery Lessons Overview
ðŸ“š Here are work products from studying the Makers Mastery Curriculum.
## What's this about?
For me this was a scrap book for key things I picked up from the Mastery Lessons. You may have a different experience completing the exercises depending on where you are in your journey.
I've made programs to solve the sandbox problems discussed and it's helped me get to grips with the finer aspects of Ruby.
## How to use this
Feel free to scan the individual README files on the key notes I picked up and see the kind of programs you are asked to solve and how I went about it.
- The READMEs are short
- I only include notes I didn't know before
- I include points I found interesting and subtle that will make a difference to how I code
